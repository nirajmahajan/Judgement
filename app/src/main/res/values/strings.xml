    <string name="fixed_trump_info">This is the conventional game of judgement, where a suit is predeclared as the \'trump\' for each round and all the players have to make their judgement accordingly.\nThe player next to the dealer starts the game\n\nThe trumps are as follows:\n1) Spades\n2) Diamonds\n3) Clubs\n4) Hearts\n\n This sequence is repeated for all the forthcoming rounds - \nS D C H (Soon Deeds Complete Here)\n"</string>

    <string name="custom_trump_info">This is a more intellectual and involved, but interesting variant of the game.\nIn this mode, there is no predeclared trump!\n All the players, starting from the dealer\'s neighbour, start making their judgement. \nSo what\'s the fun here? \nWell the catch is that the player with the maximum \'bid\' gets to choose a trump of his liking!\n In case of a tie in the bids, the player who placed the maximum bid first will get the chance to choose the trump.\n\n So basically a player has to place his bid in either of the two ways:\n1) Place a nominal bid, so that you can win, irrespective of the trump\n2) Go Big and aim for the trump!\n\n\n\n\n </string>
